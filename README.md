# Lens Improvement Proposals (LIPs)

The objective of the LIPs is to establish uniformity and offer comprehensive documentation for Lens, including the conventions and frameworks built on top of it. This repository monitors both completed and ongoing enhancements to Lens through the LIPs.

This repository will contain all the open standards that are used by Lens Protocol. The standards are divided into folders. Each folder contains a specific type of standard. For example, the `lens-open-algorithm-standards` folder contains all the standards that are related to the Lens Open Algorithm Standards.

This repository draws significant inspiration from the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and their well-structured format. We have made an effort to closely adhere to the same format in order to maintain familiarity for those accustomed to it. As a result, there should be little that feels entirely new to individuals who are accustomed to working with EIPs.

## Contributing

We have different types of proposals which currently are:

- Protocol
- Lens Ecosystem Standard
- Lens Metadata Standard
- Lens Open Algorithm Standard

All of these can go through an LIP process. Lens Open Algorithm Standards are the only ones that are not required to go through the LIP process as has its own flow. That said if you want to improve that standards an LIP can be opened for it.
