# Publication metadata standard

With the publication metadata standards growing and growing we have decided to split out the metadata into many easy to understand JSON schemas, alongside examples of how to use them. On top of this each main publication focus will have its own versioning this allows us to extend for example `AUDIO` metadata without having to bump the version of the `VIDEO` metadata, allowing these standards to improve side by side and build communities around shaping them.

These standard defines the metadata for a publication. This includes `POST`, `COMMENTS` and `MIRRORs`.
