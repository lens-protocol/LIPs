# make lens collects great
goal of this LIP is to enable creators to create posts on lens that result in NFTs appealing to secondary market customers. (= look (headline, description) and feel (attributes) must be comparable to state of the art media NFTs available on OpenSea e.g.) 
Nice to have: enable collections on lens.

##motivation
thanks to $BONSAI and lens going permissionless, paid collects get some attention (again). Creators start minting on lens (again) and #lensfrens collect (with $BONSAI). Thats great and an important first step. The next step to keep the momentum is a thriving secondary market for lens collects. Imo state of the art NFT meta data is prerequisite to "make it" on market places.

## status quo

We saw the discussion around collects, meta data and market places over and over again on lens. @lens/chaoticmonk , @lens/carstenpoetter , @lens/ryanfox and many more posted frequently regarding the importance of this topic.

I'm neither from an technical nor from an artist/creator side knowledgable enough to push this any further. BUT I'm convinced that it's an important topic and this LIP should bring all the relevant people together - from a tech and creator side - to find an amazing solution. 

(LIP 42a: we need full content search on @lens/lens !) 
(LIP 42b: let's bring LIPs on @lens/lens !)
