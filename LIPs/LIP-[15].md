## Motivation

<!--
  Lens is going permissionless, which means that there is going to be a large influx of new users into the ecosystem. This prompts the question, how do we get the best possible UX to onboard  these users? And is polygon the sole answer? I would say no it is not. Coinbase has shown its dedication to providing this however on their L2 base; hence, I am suggesting that Lens be deployed in a compatible way with base, whether that's base itself or an L3 on base. The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Specification

<!--
  Lens protocol should make it possible to host a profile and submit transactions that conduct all the same functionality on polygon and momoka also on base.
-->

## Rationale

<!--
  This LIP is mostly driven by Jesse P's dialect on the Mint podcast by Adam Levy. It seems apparent if you listen to their conversation that Base is dedicated to serving users to creators. Being in the ecosystem for awhile, its apparent that creators will go through further hoops to distribute content and make their way to Lens, while users need a more easily catered experience. Furthermore, Coinbase could also take a stab at the verification for real users on base that we might otherwise not get the chance to access. These reasons are why I am recommending that Lens Deploy to Base.
