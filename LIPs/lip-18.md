## Abstract

The Lens platform is revolutionizing the way users interact with the Metaverse through its innovative handle system and NFT integration. However, to further enhance accessibility and usability, we propose the integration of multiple currencies for handle purchases and the introduction of NFT minting tickets for onboarding friends.


## Motivation

The current system on Lens, primarily reliant on wMATIC for handle purchases, presents a barrier to entry for users who may prefer to transact in alternative currencies such as Bonsai. Additionally, facilitating the onboarding process for friends to join the Lens ecosystem can be cumbersome, requiring manual assistance and gas payments. By expanding currency options and introducing minting tickets, Lens aims to democratize access and streamline user onboarding.

## Specification and Rationale
1. Multi-Currency Support for Handle Purchases

Specification:
Integrate smart contract functionality to allow handle purchases using multiple currencies, including but not limited to wMATIC, USDC and Bonsai.
Implement a dynamic exchange rate mechanism to ensure fair pricing and currency conversion during transactions.

Rationale:
By accommodating various currencies, Lens broadens its user base and promotes inclusivity within the Metaverse.
Offering flexibility in payment options enhances user experience and encourages engagement with the platform.

2. Handle Minting Tickets for Onboarding

Specification:
Introduce handle minting tickets as transferable tokens representing the right to mint a handle on Lens.
Enable users to purchase and transfer minting tickets to friends, allowing them to claim a handle with their desired name.
Include preloaded gas fees transfer within minting tickets to eliminate barriers related to transaction costs for onboarding users.

Rationale:
Minting tickets simplify the onboarding process by providing a streamlined method for users to onboard friends to Lens.
Preloaded gas fees remove the burden of transaction costs from the recipient, reducing friction and enhancing the onboarding experience.
