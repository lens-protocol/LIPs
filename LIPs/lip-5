## Abstract

<!--
 Lens Protocol has been in Beta for almost two years now. It’s been quite a long time since the idea of on-chain social emerged with the Lens Open Letter. 
The protocol has come a long way since then by increasing the amount of clients, scalability, and apps on Lens. With all this said, it’s time for Lens to open the protocol to the community, so it can progress to decentralization. 
-->

## Motivation

<!--
 Earlier this week, a conversation on Farcaster made strides on Lens, which commented on how Farcaster is getting an upper edge on Lens purely because it's permissionless.
Since Lens has made tremendous progress on the technical side of protocol (Momoka, Lens V2, ext) the community has come to the consensus that it’s time for the opening of Lens.
-->

## Specification and Rationale

<!--
 While it is time for Lens to open, it should be in a healthy progression towards decentralization. 
The Lens core team should look to do this by putting in safety measures for when it goes permissionless to combat the risk of spam. 
Front ends should have their own measures to mitigate risks associated with a large influx of users. As for the opening, @defispartan suggested anyone who can pay the gas to mint a profile should have the right to do so to make Lens as permissionsless as possible.
Also, I suggest that there also should be a small nominal fee for a specific handle. Handles are optional as the profile is what holds all of the user’s social graph; however, purchasing handles could be the initial funding mechanism to sponsor transactions on Momoka. 
Additionally, as @defispartan suggested profiles should be included into the subsidized fees program based on well intentioned engagement, an example of how this would work would be using a floating/community based threshold of the reputation score from Big Query for subsidized posting. 
Furthermore, Lens should have an unbiased - permissionless way to open up the protocol, with reasonable measures in place, and a strategic plan for subsidizing fees for profiles.
