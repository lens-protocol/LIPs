## Motivation

We want Lens to be a community ran project with standards shaped by everyone, as more builders use Lens we want them to have a voice and be able to promote ideas easily and in a way which would get eyes on it. LIPs is a great way to do this and we should start using it. Inspiration from [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/) was taken.

## Specification

Have a LIP template to allow anyone to propose.
