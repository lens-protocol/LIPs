#LIP-10 “3 birds with one LIP” - bring LIPs back to @lens/lens x enable full content search x strategic app grants / development initiatives.

“As Lens Protocol is a neutral and flexible technology stack for social networking use-cases, LIPs provides the basis to ensure that Lens Protocol remains flexible and uniform across all potential use-cases, improvements and ideas within the community.”  … and therefore the home for LIPs should be @lens/lens. 
advantages: 
(1) accessibility: literally every lens user can join discussions and add ideas without any barrier of entry. (Status quo: setup of a GitHub
 profile, getting used to the app and the (technical) workflow coming with the process currently implemented).
(2) visibility: based on the amount of comments and the profiles participating in the discussions so far, LIPs will get an amazing visibility in the broader lens community. 

Disadvantages: LIPs won’t be easily accessible as soon as they are in the lower end of the feed. -> workaround: use of the #LIP hashtag eg #LIP-10. solution(s): 
#LIP-10b1 full content search. 
#LIP-10b2 grant for a lens based developer platform.

#LIP-10b1  #hashtags and profiles are the only elements searchable on lens at the moment. Trying to find content (posts and especially comments) again is a very time consuming and challenging endeavour.
The goal of this #LIP is to enable full content search on lens (via the lens API).

Lens Ecosystem (Standard)
#LIP-10b2 hackathons are great but have you ever tried incentivising the development of “strategic apps”? 
I don’t think that “web2 but decentralised” is a (user) winning approach. In this specific case the combination of a developer platform app with a decentralised general purpose social graph AND leveraging the “internet of value” - rewarding devs building open source code (project X uses code from dev Y and compensates dev Y if project X succeeds) sounds interesting (imo). 
Independent of this specific case, having a lens fund supporting and incentivising projects being built on lens might be worth trying.
