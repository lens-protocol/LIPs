# [LIP-17] make lens collects great
The goal of this LIP is to enable creators to create posts on lens that result in NFTs appealing to secondary market customers. 

(= look (headline, description) and feel (attributes) must be comparable to state of the art media NFTs available on OpenSea e.g.) 

**Nice to have**: enable collections on lens.

## motivation
Thanks to $BONSAI and lens going permissionless, paid collects get some attention (again). Creators start minting on lens (again) and #lensfrens collect (with $BONSAI). Thats great and an important first step. The next step to keep the momentum is a thriving secondary market for lens collects. Imo state of the art NFT meta data is prerequisite to "make it" on market places.

### example
Lens collect: https://hey.xyz/posts/0x018ec4-0x0194

* status quo: https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x5d891e31b19285336cf6ba9d7643935bb1f3ee8a/1
* goal: https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x524cab2ec69124574082676e6f654a18df49a048/11671

We saw the discussion around collects, meta data and market places over and over again on lens. @lens/chaoticmonk , @lens/carstenpoetter , @lens/ryanfox and many more posted frequently regarding the importance of this topic.

## next steps
This LIP should bring all relevant people and ideas together - from a tech and creator side - to find an amazing solution shaping the future of NFTs on lens.
